							<h2>Testimonials</h2>
							<blockquote>
								<p>In 2006, I had the opportunity to study abroad in London, England -along with my Washington University classmates. I remember going to the Delmar Loop to find some earrings to take with me. As I strolled along the Boulevard, I spotted the most enchanting shop called "Diversity Gallery."  When I entered, it felt like I had been translated to another amazingly beautiful dimension!! The cozy space was jammed-packed with unique African and African American artwork, tapestries, beauty products, fragrances, and jewelry! I was so amazed and delighted! Then, a beautiful, charming woman emerged from the back of the shop, turned on some improvisational jazz, and burned some heady incense. She had these perfectly coifed honey brown locks that she wore on the top of her head-I knew I was at home. "Welcome to Diversity Gallery, I'm Leslie, may I help you?" I was speechless-at first-because she was so regal and confident in who she was. She was everything I wanted to be. I explained what I wanted and where I was going, and we began to talk about everything. By the time I left, she had transferred some of her confidence to me and I have never been the same. Today, she is my mentor and still pours blessings into my life. If you are looking for an experience that will change your life, then step into Diversity Gallery, it will be the best decision you've ever made.</p>
