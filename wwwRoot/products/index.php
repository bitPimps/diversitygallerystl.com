							<h2>About Leslie</h2>
							<p>Welcome to Diversity Gallery, a place where I share my passion and inspiration for beauty and hair care, art, and jewelry making.</p>
							<p>I created Diversity Gallery in 2000 as a place to empower my community to reach its highest potential. I wanted to do more than just sell products &mdash; I hoped to offer a lifestyle, one that encouraged others to feel beautiful and uniquely themselves. Over the years, and with a lot of support from our friends, Diversity Gallery has grown into a meaningful St. Louis institution, a place that offers something for everyone.</p>
							<p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, where I still live with my wonderful husband and three daughters. I am very active within my community, consulting other local businesses and performing leadership roles. I am also a Fashion and Jewelry Designer, Natural Hair Stylist, Event Planner, Motivational Speaker and Lifestyle Coach.</p>
